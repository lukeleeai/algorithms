    "Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.\n",

    "At first, with [1 a b c d e 1] I tried increasing the window size from the start. For example, it considers [1, a], then [1, a, b], [1, a, b, c], and so on. Then, I realized that each time I expand the window, it encounters new character that introduces other multiple possible combinations to consider. We need a different approach."

    "**Reverse Thinking** is all we need. My approach was based on the premise that I have to consider which balloon to burst \"first.\" Yet the real problem lies in the next round that introduces other variables. So what if we decide which balloon $i$ to burst \"last?\" Then, we can for sure divide this problem into two subsets that surrounds the balloon $i$ and that don't affect each other! From this idea, we can continue on solving this problem using dynamic programming that starts from bottom to top."
